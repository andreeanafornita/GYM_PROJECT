# GYM_PROJECT
# Fitness Hub Application

This application was developed in the C# programming language. The main goal of the application is to provide a useful and accessible interface for users of all kinds. When you launch the project, you'll be directed to the main menu, where users are categorized as either Admin or Client. If a user is a client, they can explore subscription types and even register as a new client. Additionally, we've added "Back" and "Save" buttons in the top bar for easy navigation, along with two save buttons on the form to store data in the database. In the "Admin" section, users can generate visual reports in the form of pie charts and access information about active members. The interface, created using Visual Studio 2023, offers practicality, intuitive navigation, and ease of use.
